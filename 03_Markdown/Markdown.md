# Quick start

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

## Initialize

If you want to write the documentation in the `./docs` subdirectory, you can use the `init` command.

```bash
docsify init ./docs
```
